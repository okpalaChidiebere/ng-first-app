# MyFirstApp

- I learned how to render Angular Components
- How to encapsulate group of DOM elements in components and how to build larger portion of the UI by composing those components together. We learned how to render static and dynamic variables in an angular template. Check these links [here](https://angular.io/guide/component-interaction) and [here](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2)
- We learned how to use `ng new my-first-app --no-strict` to create a new bare template. Without routing configured.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Set up

- Make sure you have Node installed in your system. If you are using Mac, you can install that with homebrew or using `nvm`
- Install the angular-cli with `npm install @angular/cli -g` You will use this command to update your angular cli in the future too. `ng --version` to check the version. You can run `ng --help` too to see all commands
- As of this time, the angular-cli supports node v16.10.0 So i had to use nvm to install this specific version running `nvm install 16.10.0` and `nvm use 16.10.0` after. So keep an eye. Each time you update the angula-cli you may have to switch up your node version :)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
